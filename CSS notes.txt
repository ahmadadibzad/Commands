There are two ways to inherit from parents:

1: inherit command:
$ font-family: inherit;

2: Using combinators:

#id h1 {
    font-family: ...
}

Note: 
combinators have higher specifity:

#id h1 {
    font-family: 'Tahoma'
}

h1 {
    font-family: Arial
}

The font-family of Tahoma will be set because combinators create a higher specifity than just the h1. In other words, the rules with more information wins over rules with less information.

-----------------------------------------------

All kinds of combinators:

1. white space
We've just seen above.

2. Adjacent sibling (+)

Example:
h2 + p
Assigns to all p tags that directly follow an h2 tag.

<h2></h2>
<p></p>  // this tag
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h2></h2>
<p></p> // and this tag

rules:
- Elements share the same parent
- The second element comes immediately after the first element.

3. General sibling (~):
Just the same as adjacent sibling, but the second tag doesn't have to be directly in front of the first tag

example:
h2 ~ p

<h2></h2>
<p></p>  // this tag
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<p></p> // and this tag
<h2></h2>
<p></p> // and this tag

rules:
- Elements share the same parent
- The second element comes after the first element.

4. Child (>):
Assigns to the direct child of an element.

<div>
	<h2></h2>
	<p></p> // this tag
	<article>
		<p></p>
	</article>
	<p></p> // and this tag
</div>

rule:
- The second element is a direct child of the first element.

=============================

Margin Collapsing:

If you got two elements next to each other, then margins between them are actually collapsed to one margin. The bigger margin wins.


=============================

Shorthand Property:

border: 1px solid black;

margin: 5px (top) 10px (right) 5px (bottom) 10px (left)
