To create a react app:
$ npx create-react-app@latest project-name

React does not render true, false, and null values:
{ true }  // nothing will be printed


=======================================
React fragment: <></>

React fragment lets us group elements without any effect in HTML DOM. Since all elements in a component in React must be in a root element, we need to group all elements in a component in a root element. But it may affect CSS. So that's the case that we can use React fragment:

<>
	<h2></h2>
	<p></p>
</>

Sometimes, we need to set a key for the React fragment. For example, in a list. In this case, we can use this:

<React.Fragment key='myKey'>
.
.
.
</React.Fragment>
