To create a react app:
$ npx create-react-app@latest project-name

or we can use vite:
$ npm create vite@latest

React does not render true, false, and null values:
{ true }  // nothing will be printed


=======================================
React fragment: <></>

React fragment lets us group elements without any effect in HTML DOM. Since all elements in a component in React must be in a root element, we need to group all elements in a component in a root element. But it may affect CSS. So that's the case that we can use React fragment:

<>
	<h2></h2>
	<p></p>
</>

Sometimes, we need to set a key for the React fragment. For example, in a list. In this case, we can use this:

<React.Fragment key='myKey'>
.
.
.
</React.Fragment>


==========================================

When we are mapping arrays in jsx, It's better to set the key for each element:


<ul>
  {
    tasks.map(task => (
      <li key={task.id}>{task.title}</li>
    ))
  }
</ul>


==========================================

Calling event handler function: 
We can call the handler function directly, or we can define a function that returns the handler function and passes in the event object.

const [task, setTask] = useState('');
const handleTaskChange = e => {
    setTask(e.target.value);
}

<input type="text" onChange={e => handleTaskChange(e)} />
OR
<input type="text" onChange={handleTaskChange} />


==========================================

React StrictMode is a tool provided by React that helps developers write better quallity code by highlighting potential problems during development. For example, it checks for:
- Not supported or deprecated React APIs and components.
- Unsafe state updates
- Potentially unnecessary re-renders.
